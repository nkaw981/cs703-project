>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?
... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i
... t is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.

To solve this problem, we'll analyze each step of the switch-flipping sequence:

1. Initially, both Switches A and B are flipped (unflipped).
2. You flip Switch B, so it's now unflipped.
3. Then you flip Switch A, so it's now flipped.
4. Next, you flip Switch A again, but since Switch A is already flipped, it remains flipped.
5. Finally, you flip Switch A once more, which again leaves it in a flipped state.

Since both switches (A and B) have been flipped in the correct order, according to the problem statement, the light should be on after this sequence of flips.
