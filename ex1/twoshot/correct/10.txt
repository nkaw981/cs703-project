>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?
... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i
... t is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.

To determine if the light is on, we need to analyze the sequence of switch flips:

1. Switch B is flipped, so it's now flipped.
2. Switch A is flipped, but since B is already flipped, the combination has changed, and the light is still off (since B was not in its original position).
3. Switch B is flipped again, restoring its original position.
4. Switch C is flipped, so it's now flipped.
5. Switch A is flipped again, so it's now flipped.
6. Switch A is flipped a third time, which means it has reached its required flip position.

Since all three switches (A, B, and C) are now flipped in the correct sequence, the light is on.

Note that if we had stopped at step 5, the light would still be off because switch A was not in its final required flip position.
