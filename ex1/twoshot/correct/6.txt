... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We start with all three switches being unflipped.

1. You flip switch C, so it is now flipped.
2. Then you flip switch A, but since switch C has been flipped, we need to flip both B and A in order for the light to be on. So, switch A remains flipped, but switch B is not yet flipped.

At the end of the sequence, only switch A has been flipped, so it is still unflipped. Since all three switches must be flipped in order for the light to be on, and only one switch (A) has been 
flipped, therefore the light is off.
