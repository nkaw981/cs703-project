We start with both switches being unflipped.

Switch A is flipped, so it is now flipped.
Switch B is flipped, but because switch A has been flipped first, we must re-flip switch A for switch B to be flipped.
At this point, switch B is not flipped yet. We flip switch B again, so it is now flipped.
Now that both switch A and switch B are flipped, the light is on.

So, yes, the light is on in this case.
