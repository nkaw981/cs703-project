>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?
... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i

... A light requires three switches, Switch A, B, and C to be flipped in order for it to be on. All three switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: A, C, B. Is the light on?
... 
To determine if the light is on, let's analyze the sequence of switch flips.

1. You flip Switch A, which becomes flipped.
2. Then you flip Switch C, but since it hasn't been flipped yet (as it was not part of the initial flip), it remains unflipped. 
3. Finally, you flip Switch B, which is now flipped because it has been flipped after being in an intermediate state (unflipped).

At the end of this sequence, both switches A and B are flipped, but switch C remains unflipped. Since two out of three switches are flipped, the light will not be on.

So, the answer to the question is: No, the light is off.
