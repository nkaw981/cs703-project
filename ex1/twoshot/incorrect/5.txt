>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?
... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i
... t is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.

... A light requires two switches, Switch A and B, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: A, B, B, B, B, A. Is the light on? 
... 
To determine if the light is on, let's analyze the sequence of switch flips.

1. You flip Switch A: It is now flipped.
2. Then you flip Switch B: Now both switches are flipped.
3. Next, you flip Switch B again: Still both switches are flipped.
4. Flip Switch B three more times: All four switches (now considering A as the first one) are flipped.
5. Finally, you flip Switch A: Since all switches have been flipped, the light is on.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the light is on at the end of the sequence.
