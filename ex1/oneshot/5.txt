>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?
... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i
... t is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.
... A light requires two switches, Switch A and B, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: A, B, B, B, B, A. Is the light on?
... 
To determine if the light is on, let's analyze the sequence of switch flips:

1. Initially, both switches are unflipped.
2. Switch A is flipped, so it's now flipped.
3. Then, switch B is flipped, making switch B flipped and switch A still flipped.
4. Next, another switch B flip occurs (no effect since it's already flipped), but this isn't the first time B has been flipped, as you can only turn a switch on once by flipping it from unflipped 
to flipped, so in this case, no change happens here as well; essentially it is still flipped.
5. The third and fourth flip of B occurs again (still not changing), then finally A gets flipped.

At the end of the sequence, both switches are flipped, which means they meet the requirement for the light to be on. Therefore, the light is on.
