>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?
... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i
... t is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.
... A light requires three switches, Switch A, B, and C to be flipped in order for it to be on. All three switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: B, A, B, B, C, A, C, A, C.
...  Is the light on?
... 
To determine if the light is on, we need to follow the sequence of switch flips and examine the state of each switch after each flip.

Initially, all switches are unflipped.

1. You flip switch B: Switch B is flipped.
2. Then you flip switch A: Switch A is flipped.
3. Next, you flip switch B again: Since switch B was just flipped, it's now unflipped.
4. Now you flip switch C: Switch C is flipped.
5. Then you flip switch A again: Since switch A was flipped, it's now unflipped.
6. After that, you flip switch C: Switch C is still flipped.
7. Next, you flip switch A once more: Switch A is flipped.
8. Finally, you flip switch C again: Switch C is still flipped.

The final state of the switches after flipping them in the given sequence is:

- Switch A: Flipped
- Switch B: Unflipped
- Switch C: Flipped

Since all three switches are flipped, the light is on.
