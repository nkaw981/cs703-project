>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?
... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i
... t is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.
... A light requires three switches, Switch A, B, and C to be flipped in order for it to be on. All three switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: A, C, B. Is the light on?
... 
Let's analyze the sequence:

Initially, all three switches are unflipped.

1. You flip Switch A, so it is now flipped.
2. You then flip Switch C. Since Switch A has been flipped, it remains flipped. However, since both Switches A and C have been flipped at this point, none of them have fulfilled the condition to 
turn the light on yet, as there's no sequence or combination required between A and C. So, this step doesn't change the state of either Switch A or Switch C.
3. Finally, you flip Switch B, which is now unflipped. 

Since none of the switches in the correct sequence have been flipped together, according to your rules, the light remains off.
