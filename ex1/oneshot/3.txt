>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?

Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so it is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.

A light requires two switches, Switch A and B, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: A, B, B. Is the light on?

Let's analyze the sequence of switch flips.

We start with both switches being unflipped.

First, we flip Switch A, so it is now flipped.

Next, we flip Switch B, which is already flipped, so it becomes unflipped. This doesn't change the state of the light because one switch was already on.

Finally, we flip Switch B again, but since it's already been flipped, it remains in the flipped state and stays on.

Since both switches (A and B) are now flipped at the end, the light is on.
