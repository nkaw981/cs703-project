>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?

Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so it is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.

A light requires two switches, Switch A and B, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: B, A, A, A. Is the light on?

To determine if the light is on, we need to analyze the sequence of switch flips.

Initially, both switches are unflipped.

1. You flip switch B first, so it's now flipped.
2. Then you flip switch A, which was previously unflipped, so it's now unflipped again.
3. Now you flip switch A again. However, since it has been unflipped twice before this sequence, it is still in the "unflipped" state.
4. Finally, you flip switch A a third time. Again, because it was previously flipped twice and then unflipped twice, it's now back to being unflipped.

At the end of this sequence, neither switch B nor switch A has been flipped an odd number of times (which is required for the light to be on), so the light remains off.
