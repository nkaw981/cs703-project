>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?

Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so it is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.

A light requires two switches, Switch A and B, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: B. Is the light on?
... 
Let's analyze the situation.

We start with both switches being unflipped. We flip switch B first, but since it has been flipped, it is now unflipped.

Since neither switch A nor switch B has been flipped twice (only once each), and they don't need to be flipped simultaneously, this sequence doesn't meet the requirements to turn on the light. 
Therefore, the light is off.
