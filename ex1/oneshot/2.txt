>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?

Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so it is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.

A light requires two switches, Switch A and B, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: A, B. Is the light on?
...
To determine if the light is on, we can apply a similar logic as before.

We start with both switches being unflipped. We flip switch A first, so it's now flipped. Then we flip switch B, but since A has already been flipped, it doesn't affect its state. So, switch B is 
also flipped, and at this point, the light is on because both switches are flipped.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the light is on after flipping switches in the order: A, B.
