>>> Question: A light requires two switches, Switch X and Y, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: X, X, Y. Is the light on?
... Answer: We start with both switches being unflipped. Switch X is flipped, so it is now flipped. Then we flip switch X, but because it has been flipped, it is now unflipped. Switch Y is flipped, so i
... t is now flipped. At the end of the sequence, switch Y is flipped, but switch X has not been flipped yet, therefore the light is off.
... A light requires three switches, Switch A, B, and C to be flipped in order for it to be on. All three switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: C, A. Is the light on?
... 
To determine if the light is on, let's analyze the sequence of switch flips:

1. Initially, all three switches are unflipped.
2. Switch C is flipped, so it's now flipped.
3. Then, switch A is flipped, making switch A flipped.

Since switch A has been flipped after switch C was already flipped, this meets the requirement for the light to be on (switch B is still unflipped). Therefore, the light is on.
