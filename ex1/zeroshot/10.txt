>>> A light requires three switches, Switch A, B, and C to be flipped in order for it to be on. All three switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: B, A, B, C, A, A, C. Is th
... e light on?
Let's analyze the switch-flipping sequence:

1. Initial state: Switches A and B are unflipped, while Switch C is flipped.
2. Flip Switch B (2nd): Switch B is now flipped. State: Switches A, B, and C have one switch each that is flipped or not flipped.
3. Flip Switch A (4th): Switch A is now flipped. State: All three switches are now flipped.
4. Since all switches are flipped, the light will be on.

So, yes, the light is on after you flip the switches in the sequence B-A-B-C-A-A-C.
