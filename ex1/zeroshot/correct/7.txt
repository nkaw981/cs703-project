>>> A light requires three switches, Switch A, B, and C to be flipped in order for it to be on. All three switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: A, C, B. Is the light on?
Let's analyze the sequence of switch flips:

1. You flip switch A, which is now on.
2. You flip switch C, which was previously off. Now, it's also on.
3. You flip switch B, but since switches A and C are already on, their states don't affect each other.

Since switches A and C were flipped after switch B, they will be considered as being "on" even if switch B is flipped off. This means that the light will not turn on until both A and C are flipped 
again, or an additional condition is met (not specified in this scenario).

However, considering only the given sequence of switches, we can conclude that:

- The light turns on when you flip switch A.
- Since switch A is already "on" from the previous step, it doesn't matter if you flip switch B now.

So, to answer your question: yes, the light will be on after you flip switch A.
