>>> A light requires three switches, Switch A, B, and C to be flipped in order for it to be on. All three switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: B, A, B, B, C, A, C, A, C.
...  Is the light on?
To determine if the light is on, we need to analyze the switch flips.

1. Initial state: All three switches are unflipped (off).
2. First flip: Switch B
3. Second flip: Switch A
4. Third flip: Switch B again
5. Fourth flip: Switch B again
6. Fifth flip: Switch C
7. Sixth flip: Switch A
8. Seventh flip: Switch C
9. Eighth flip: Switch A

Now, let's analyze the switches:

- Switch A is flipped three times (flipped on/off/ flipped), which means it has an odd number of flips, so it ends up in its original state, unflipped.
- Switch B is flipped three times (on/off/on), also resulting in an even number of flips, so it ends up in the opposite of its initial state. However, since there's no "off" switch to flip back 
into, it remains flipped.
- Switch C is flipped three times (flipped on/ off/flipped), which means it also ends up in its original state.

Since we can't "flip a switch back", Switch B will remain flipped, and the light will be on.
