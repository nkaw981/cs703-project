>>> A light requires two switches, Switch A and B, to be flipped in order for it to be on. Both switches start unflipped. I flip the switches in the following order: B, A, A, A. Is the light on?
Let's analyze the sequence of switch flips:

1. You flip Switch B.
2. You flip Switch A.
3. You flip Switch A again (which is not necessary, as it was already flipped).
4. You flip Switch A once more.

Since Switch B is now flipped, it can be on its own if there's a way for the light to work with just one switch, but that's not specified. However, we know that both switches need to be flipped 
together in order to turn the light on.

Let's assume that there's only one configuration where both switches A and B are flipped simultaneously (e.g., a specific setting or combination). 

If this is true, then none of your flip sequences meet this condition.

However, it might also be possible that the light requires both Switch A and B to be in a different state. For instance, if the light turns on when either one of them is flipped while the other 
switch is already flipped, or there's an additional third switch.

We can only determine for sure whether the light is on by knowing more about how it works or what configuration makes it turn on.

So, unfortunately, we cannot be certain that the light will turn on with your specific sequence.
